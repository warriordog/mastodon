Custom fork of Mastodon federated social network server

---

This is a customized version of the [Glitch-soc Mastodon fork](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon)
with a few minor changes to improve user experience.

## Differences from glitch-soc
* New setting "use local links" added to restore the vanilla mastodon behavior of opening profiles and posts through the local instance
* Supports quote-posts based on the [Treehouse Systems fork](https://gitea.treehouse.systems/treehouse/mastodon)
* Link to official app is removed (there are privacy issues, please use a 3rd party app or mobile web)

## Planned changes
* Filter from home only (allow in lists)

## Usage
Follow standard instructions for glitch-soc.
No workflow changes are needed!
